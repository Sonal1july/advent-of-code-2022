What is Advent of Code (AoC)?

Every day starting on December 1 and going through December 25, a new coding puzzle unlocks at midnight EST time (11pm CST, 10:30AM IST). The puzzle consists of a humorous story that describes a puzzle to be solved, and a set of input that you must use to solve the puzzle. You can solve the puzzle however you want, taking as much time as you like, and when you think you've got it, submit the answer. If the answer is correct, part two of the daily puzzle unlocks. Each day, the puzzle is in two parts and the second is generally harder than the first.

There is no right or wrong way to solve the puzzles. You can use whatever language or tools you like to solve them. I am using JAVA
